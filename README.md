## Instruction: 

1.	Create a database name myshopdb with table name tbl_products in MySQL database. You can use XAMPP/webhosting.
2.	Create a server directory call \myshop with \php and \images folder in the server directory.  
3.	Create a new flutter project with the following package name [com.<yourmatricno>.midtermstiw2044myshop] 
4.	Create a floating button in the main layout (main.dart). This button then should navigate to the form stated in 5.
5.	Based on the above class diagram, create a form (newproduct.dart) to fill in data into the table. Include a picture from the camera or gallery app as part of the input form. You need to create a backend API (newproduct.php) to insert data into the database and upload the image. Make sure to store the image into the \images folder.
6.	Once the data successfully inserted into the database, the form interface will pop and navigate back to the main layout where here it should display all the data from the database back to the user in a card grid view. Use grid layout with 2 columns to display data. Display product image, name, type, price, and quantity in the card list.
